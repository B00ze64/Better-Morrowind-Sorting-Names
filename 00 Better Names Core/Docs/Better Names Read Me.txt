This is a MWSE script that renames some items in Morrowind so that they sort
together in your inventory and in your containers. Bethesda's insistence on
naming everything with a quality/material adjective FIRST means that it's a bit
difficult sometimes to ascertain which items you have, because items of the same
kind are spread around.

Better Sorting Names tries to help with that. It tries to keep sets together, as
per default Morrowind (like all Glass Armor in a group), but also tries to put
same-kind items together, like all Longswords together, and all Axes together,
etc. Some obvious candidates for renaming are the bracers and pauldrons, which
are named "Left Pauldron" and "Right Pauldron" in Morrowind, meaning they are
not together in your inventory. To fix this, Better Sorting Names renames them
to "Pauldron Left" and "Pauldron Right" so that they group. Other obvious
candidates are Potions, which now group by Effect and not by Quality (if you
decide to enable this). Soulgems, and Clothing, especially from Clothiers of
Vvardenfell, also benefit greatly.

Keys and Propylon indexes are other items in dire need of renaming, but  they
are not included in Better Sorting Names, since there's a mod for  that already,
see [Consistent Keys](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47954) and
[Propylon Index Renamer](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49941) by
Necrolesian.

Better Sorting Names will rename the following categories of items, and each
category can be turned Off/On in the Mod Config Menu:

- Armor (Left Pauldron -> Pauldron Left)
- Clothing (Common Pants -> Pants Common)
- Potions using "Effect Quality" (Exclusive Potion of Fortify Luck > Fortify Luck Exclusive)
- or Potions using "Potion Effect Quality" (Potion of Fortify Luck > Potion Fortify Luck Exclsv) [31 Chars Max]
- Weapons (Silver Longsword -> Longsword Silver)
- Souldgems (Greater Soulgem -> Soulgem Greater)

Additionally, you can:

- Give MW/Trib/BM potions an inventory icon badge (same as Labeled_Potions-44374 by r0)
- Give custom potions an icon badge (this is decided when installing Better Sorting Names)
- Rename books that give a skill with "+Skill#" (e.g. 36 Vivec Lessons +14) [+1 Mysticism]
- Give Higher Quality Tools (e.g. Lockpicks) more uses than cheaper ones (makes sense no?)

The mod supports items from:

- Morrowind, Tribunal and Bloodmoon.
- PFP corrections to item names are included.
- Tamriel-Data items (that's a lot of extra items).
- OAAB-Data (another source of items).
- Clothiers of Vvardenfell (a lot of items here too).
- Morrowind Public Library (the Tea's [potions]).
- Abot's Water Life (A few items).
- Hunter's Mark - A Marksman Mod.
- Area Effect Arrows.
- An Issue Of Thrust.
- Crossbows Enhanced-48586
- More Useful Spears-42450
- And any other mod I use...

Since I do not use a lot of "New Items" mods, there is a lot that is not covered
by Better Sorting Names, so I setup a Github where you can make Pull Requests to
rename other mod items:

INSTALLATION
------------

00 Better Names Core

	This is the MWSE Better Sorting Names script and the badges for the
	regular potions.

01 Custom Potions Badge

	This is an extra badge for OTHER potions. This CANNOT be toggled in the
	Mod Config menu, so if you install the 01 folder, your custom potions
	will have the badge, and if you do not enable the badges in the Mod
	Config Menu, then ALL potions will have the custom badge.
